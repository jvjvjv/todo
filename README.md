# TO DO

Quick _To Do_ project I'm making for work. See, I just need a simple "TO DO" list that I can add to. I don't need bells and whistles. Heck, this thing uses `localStorage` to save the data from day to day!

## Setup

1. Download repository and run `bower install`
2. Launch in browser.

## Functions

* Add tasks from the 'Add' section at the bottom
* Tasks appear at the top of the page
* When you're done a task, click on it to mark it as complete.
* `?` pulls up info on import/export

## See it in action!
